# dating-plan-ai-agents

## Overview

This is your new Kedro project, which was generated using `kedro 0.19.9`.

Take a look at the [Kedro documentation](https://docs.kedro.org) to get started.

## Rules and guidelines

In order to get the best out of the template:

* Don't remove any lines from the `.gitignore` file we provide
* Make sure your results can be reproduced by following a data engineering convention
* Don't commit data to your repository
* Don't commit any credentials or your local configuration to your repository. Keep all your credentials and local configuration in `conf/local/`

## How to install dependencies

Declare any dependencies in `requirements.txt` for `pip` installation.

To install them, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run your Kedro pipeline

You can run your Kedro project with:

```
kedro run
```

## How to test your Kedro project

Have a look at the file `src/tests/test_run.py` for instructions on how to write your tests. You can run your tests as follows:

```
pytest
```

You can configure the coverage threshold in your project's `pyproject.toml` file under the `[tool.coverage.report]` section.


## Project dependencies

To see and update the dependency requirements for your project use `requirements.txt`. You can install the project requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

[Further information about project dependencies](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/kedro_project_setup/dependencies.html#project-specific-dependencies)

## How to work with Kedro and notebooks

> Note: Using `kedro jupyter` or `kedro ipython` to run your notebook provides these variables in scope: `context`, 'session', `catalog`, and `pipelines`.
>
> Jupyter, JupyterLab, and IPython are already included in the project requirements by default, so once you have run `pip install -r requirements.txt` you will not need to take any extra steps before you use them.

### Jupyter
To use Jupyter notebooks in your Kedro project, you need to install Jupyter:

```
pip install jupyter
```

After installing Jupyter, you can start a local notebook server:

```
kedro jupyter notebook
```

### JupyterLab
To use JupyterLab, you need to install it:

```
pip install jupyterlab
```

You can also start JupyterLab:

```
kedro jupyter lab
```

### IPython
And if you want to run an IPython session:

```
kedro ipython
```

### How to ignore notebook output cells in `git`
To automatically strip out all output cell contents before committing to `git`, you can use tools like [`nbstripout`](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout). For example, you can add a hook in `.git/config` with `nbstripout --install`. This will run `nbstripout` before anything is committed to `git`.

> *Note:* Your output cells will be retained locally.

## Package your Kedro project

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
